       I currently attend the University of Texas at Austin, where I am pursuing a M.S./PhD
       supervised by <a href="http://www.profheath.org/" target="_blank"> Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr</a>.
       My primary research is integrating signal processing and machine learning for Wireless
       communications.

      I just finished my first semester, where I took foundational courses
      in probability and estimation. I also got started in research, and began my first
      paper, Deep Learning-based Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation with 1-Bit ADCs. I show first that
      deep learning is both effective and beneficial for classic frequency estimation tasks
      where there is more noise or strict requirements for parallelism. Below is
      the abstract and author list. We have also recently submitted for a second special session
      at Asilomar 2020, with brief details outlined below. The authors wish to thank Samsung Research America
      for their sponsorship of our work.

    <h4> Deep Learning-based Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation with 1-Bit ADCs </h4>
    <i> Ryan M. Dreifuerst, Robert W. Heath Jr, Mandar Kulknari, Jianzhong (Charlie) Zhang </i>
    <p style="font-size:15px">
      Low resolution architectures are a power efficient solution for high bandwidth communication at millimeter wave
      and TeraHertz frequencies. In such systems, carrier synchronization is important yet has not received much attention in prior
      work. In this paper, we develop and analyze deep learning architectures for estimating the carrier frequency of a complex sinusoid
      in noise from the 1-bit samples of the in-phase and quadrature components. Carrier frequency offset estimation from a sinusoid
      is used in GSM and is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive solution with other kinds of signals.
      We train four different deep learning architectures each on five datasets which represent possible training considerations.
      Specifically, we consider how training with various signal to noise ratios (SNR), quantization, and sequence lengths affects
      estimation error. Further, we compare each architecture in terms of scalability for MIMO receivers. In simulations, we compare
      computational complexity, scalability, and mean squared error versus classic signal processing techniques. We conclude that
      training with quantized data, drawn from signals with SNR between 0-10dB tends to improve deep learning estimator performance
      across the range of interest. We conclude that convolutional models have the best performance, while also scaling for
      massive MIMO situations more efficiently than FFT models. Our approach is able to accurately estimate carrier frequencies
      from 1-bit quantized data with fewer pilots and lower signal to noise ratios (SNRs) than traditional signal processing methods.

    <h4> Frequency Synchronization for Low Resolution Millimeter-Wave </h4>
    <i> Ryan M. Dreifuerst, Robert W. Heath Jr, Mandar Kulknari, Jianzhong (Charlie) Zhang </i>
    <p style="font-size:15px">
      Carrier synchronization in high bandwidth millimeter wave (mmWave) systems is challenging due to difficult optimizations between cost, power, and resolution. We propose an efficient waveform and algorithm for mmWave communication and low resolution receivers based on structural properties of the training sequences. We show in simulations how our method is able to estimate frequency offset with few-bit ADCs in wideband channels with reasonable errors relative to the infinite resolution cases.
