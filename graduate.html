       I currently attend the University of Texas at Austin, where I am pursuing a M.S./PhD
       supervised by <a href="http://www.profheath.org/" target="_blank"> Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr</a>.
       My primary research is integrating signal processing and machine learning for Wireless
       communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my first year, and I can safely say it was a huge year for me.
      I took foundational courses in probability, estimation, and machine learning.
      Most recently, I took a course on statistical machine learning, which was both
      incredibly interesting and quite tough. My research kicked off well, with
      "Deep Learning-based Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation with 1-Bit ADCs"
      accepted to <a href="https://spawc2020.netlify.app/">SPAWC 2020</a>.
      I was able to give a recorded presentation of that paper as well, which are two
      big milestones in my research career. I am now working on the follow up work,
      which focuses on multiple sinusoid detection and estimation. For more information
      about my research, head over to the research tab.

      I was also intended to intern at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Labs</a>,
      however, that was canceled as a result of COVID-19. Luckily, the wireless team
      at <a href="https://connectivity.fb.com/">Facebook</a> was looking for assistance with simulations and AI for developing
      Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) functionality. I will update this as the summer
      ends and I can give a complete picture of my work.

    <h4> Deep Learning-based Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation with 1-Bit ADCs </h4>

    <p style="font-size:15px">
      Low resolution architectures are a power efficient solution for high bandwidth communication at millimeter wave
      and TeraHertz frequencies. In such systems, carrier synchronization is important yet has not received much attention in prior
      work. In this paper, we develop and analyze deep learning architectures for estimating the carrier frequency of a complex sinusoid
      in noise from the 1-bit samples of the in-phase and quadrature components. Carrier frequency offset estimation from a sinusoid
      is used in GSM and is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive solution with other kinds of signals.
      We train four different deep learning architectures each on five datasets which represent possible training considerations.
      Specifically, we consider how training with various signal to noise ratios (SNR), quantization, and sequence lengths affects
      estimation error. Further, we compare each architecture in terms of scalability for MIMO receivers. In simulations, we compare
      computational complexity, scalability, and mean squared error versus classic signal processing techniques. We conclude that
      training with quantized data, drawn from signals with SNR between 0-10dB tends to improve deep learning estimator performance
      across the range of interest. We conclude that convolutional models have the best performance, while also scaling for
      massive MIMO situations more efficiently than FFT models. Our approach is able to accurately estimate carrier frequencies
      from 1-bit quantized data with fewer pilots and lower signal to noise ratios (SNRs) than traditional signal processing methods.

    <h4> Frequency Synchronization for Low Resolution Millimeter-Wave </h4>
    <i> Ryan M. Dreifuerst, Robert W. Heath Jr, Mandar Kulknari, Jianzhong (Charlie) Zhang </i>
    <p style="font-size:15px">
        Low resolution data converters can enable power efficient high bandwidth
        communication at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies.
        Synchronization of such systems is a critical step in accurate decoding,
        yet current approaches require long block lengths or fail to reach the
        Cram{\'e}r Rao Bound (CRB). Prior solutions have traditionally been
        divided into two distinct focuses: algorithms and designed sequences
        for synchronization. In this paper, we develop a jointly optimized
        neural architecture for frequency synchronization from configurable
        sequences and estimators. Our proposed technique uses two neural
        networks to generate sequences and determine the carrier frequency
        offset of the sequence after propagating through a channel and applying
        one-bit quantization. Our simulations show that we can improve estimation
        performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) by up to 8dB at little
        cost compared to the same estimator without the sequence generator.
        Our proposed system is fast, efficient, and easily updated, allowing it
        to handle time-varying systems. In conclusion, we believe further
        investigation in jointly optimized pilot sequences and estimators will
        be fundamental to handling signal processing techniques with low
        resolution data converters.  </p>
