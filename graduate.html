       I currently attend the University of Texas at Austin, where I am pursuing a M.S./PhD
       supervised by <a href="http://www.profheath.org/" target="_blank"> Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr</a>.
       My primary research is integrating signal processing and machine learning for Wireless
       communications.

      I just finished my first semester, where I took foundational courses
      in probability and estimation. I also got started in research, and began my first
      paper, Deep Learning for Frequency Estimation in 6G Applications. I show first that
      deep learning is both effective and beneficial for classic signal processing tasks
      where there is more noise or strict requirements for parallelism. Below is
      the abstract and author list. The authors wish to thank Samsung Research America
      for their sponsorship of our work.

    <h4> Deep Learning-based Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation with 1-Bit ADCs </h4>
    <i> Ryan M. Dreifuerst, Robert W. Heath Jr, Mandar Kulknari </i>
    <p style="font-size:15px">
      Low resolution architectures are a power efficient solution for high bandwidth
      communication at millimeter wave and TeraHertz frequencies. In such systems,
      carrier synchronization is important yet has not received much attention in
      prior work. In this paper, we develop and analyze deep learning architectures
      that are able to accurately predict carrier frequency offset from 1-bit quantized
      data with less pilot data and lower signal to noise ratios than traditional signal
      processing methods. We compare each architecture style in terms of scalability for
      future 5G and 6G base stations. We demonstrate different training methods and
      evaluate how the models perform when trained in each method. Finally, simulation
      results of the models' computational complexity, scalability, and mean squared
      error versus classic signal processing techniques show the effectiveness of
      deep learning for low resolution frequency estimation.
