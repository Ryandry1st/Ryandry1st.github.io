      Buffalo trace (BT) has a few different tour options that are all free although some

      (EH Taylor, Blantons, Eagle Rare, Weller SR), but they only sell one of those
      each day, you can only buy one of each per 3 months, they and sell out fairly
      early in the morning. We could tour one day and swing through another morning (9:30am)
      to get a different bottle. I would recommend the Old Taylor or Hard Hat tours
      if we can get them.

      Woodford reserve is a pretty well known brand, although they don't have a full range
      of products like buffalo trace or old forester. The tour is supposed to be pretty
      good according to reddit based on the very modern and refined distillery. The tasting
      might have one special bottle and depending on the time of year they may have their
      master distiller series in the giftshop. Overall this tour is more on the distillery
      than the whiskey.

      Four roses has two locations, one where they distill (here) and one where they
      store and bottle (near Jim beam). The tour is supposed to be ok and the tasting is
      their readily available stuff (small batch, single barrel, small batch select).
      The big thing is that they regularly (almost 50% of days) release their barrel strength
      bottles in one of the gift shops and have those for sale for a few hours. These tend
      to be some of the most highly rated bottles at their price (~$85). Outside of Buffalo
      trace and heaven hill, four roses is the most likely to get an "allocated" bottle.

      Wild turkey (WT) is a hard one that may require us to make a later decision on. For
      the last couple years they have been doing rennovations, so that there are no tours
      and even their usual gift shop is closed with a pop-up bar/gift shop across the street.
      When they were running this was a favorite tour because one of the master distillers often
      met with the group, talked about all the details of WT and signed bottles/clothes.
      If we want to swing through for an old fashioned, or try our luck for a rare bottle we can,
      but they haven't announced when the tours will be open again. That being said,
      they have good whiskey and Eric really enjoys them, so might be worth seeing
      if we can get the master distiller to sign something!

      Three boys farm (also branded Whiskey Thief) is one of the small-time distilleries that everyone recommends
      visiting in the area. They work with some other brands but most of their stuff is
      single barrel, custom stuff. Their tour is supposed to be excellent with (5)
      tastings right from the barrel, and you can buy your own bottle right from the barrels
      tasted. Great if you want to support a small time distillery or try whiskey right
      from the barrel.

      Old forester (OF) is the first from group B that is located in downtown Louisville.
      This group has the benefit that everything is walkable and many of the elevated
      tours give you highly desirable tastings. Old forester is supposedly a great tour
      with a rich history and good tasting options. They randomly (10% of the time) have
      their single barrels available for sale. Their elevated tour is expensive at $70,
      but it includes tasting a single barrel and their birthday bourbon, which is one of
      the most desirable bourbons on the market (and beats pappy in tastings). The elevated
      tour is available most fridays and saturdays at 12:30 or 1:30pm, but sells out fast.

      Evan williams is a change-up from most distilleries because Evan Williams is (mostly)
      the budget brand for Heaven Hill. The way EW differentiates itself from other distilleries
      is they have a speakeasy tour, which is essentially a tour through drinks with the bartender
      giving you the history through tasting. Many people recommend this as a way to
      break up the distillery tours that can become somewhat repetitive. They also sometimes
      have evan williams 12 year and 23 year but may require chatting up the
      bartender/gift shop people.

      Michters is another distillery right on this stretch of road and has become a premier
      distillery. They have three tiers of tours, although only the basic and elevated

      with (7) different drinks including three very high end samples. They will sometimes
      have high-end bottles for sale, but it seems to be more luck than anything else, and
      the price of their high end bottles starts high ($150+).

      Heaven hill is a top brand when it comes to whiskey, with good bottles at every price point.

      a great tasting and the opportunity to buy a bottle of any of the tasting samples which

     Bardstown Bourbon Company (BBC) is a newer brand that has made a name for itself by
     blending together barrel strength bourbons with different ages, mashbills, and finishes.
     They tend to be a pricier brand, althoug the BBC Origin is generally affordable at ~$50.
     Lately they have gotten a number of good reviews although some people don't like that
     they don't put an age statement on their bottles due to mixing things like a 5yr, 7yr, and 12yr together.
     They have many tour options and I honestly don't know what they will have for bottles,
     but the tasting option gets good reviews and they have one of the best distillery-restuarants
     reportedly.
