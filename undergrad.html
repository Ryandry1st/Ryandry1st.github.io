      <!-- <img class="logo" src="https://ryandry1st.github.io/figs/MSOE_Campus.jpg"> -->
      <p> I began my bachelors degree in electrical engineering at
        <a href="https://www.msoe.edu">Milwaukee School of Engineering</a> (MSOE).
        During my freshman and sophomore years, I primarily learned about
        circuit and digital hardware design. I took five circuits courses, two courses in VHDL,
        and three project management lectures. I conclude those summers with two internships,
        the first was at the Sun Prairie Area School district, where I worked as a summer
        technology intern. I managed a team of six other interns in the cleaning and repair of
        over 5,000 chromebooks, which were then redistributed to school district students.
        The second summer I interned with Plexus as a Digital Hardware Design Intern.
        This put me in a design role where I learned about the design process and got
        to go through the nitty gritty tasks like BOM magagement and schematic design. I also
        was able to lead a schematic review with customer engineers, and assisted in
        three other schematic reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then for my junior year I studied abroad in Luebeck, Germany, where I obtained
        a second bachelor's degree in electrical and communications engineering.
        The cirriculm in Germany is very different from American universities, specifically
        in how laboratory courses are taught. They begin with ~ 10 weeks of lectures
        during the lab times and then end with 4-5 weeks of pure lab excerises.
        During this time I had lectures and labs in Radiofrequencies, Microwaves,
        analog and digital controls, CAD design, and Principles of Communication I-II.
        The communications courses focused first on the physical layer and mac layers
        before spending the second semester with the rest of the OSI layer. The semester
        ran until the end of July, where I picked back up a second internship with Plexus.
      </p>
      <p>
        There I had the opportunity to design and implement the communication protocol
        for a massive, high resolution, MRI data stream. This device was implemented on an FPGA
        and took in data from 32 streams of 24 bit ADC's across four different boards.
        This was then filtered, packetized, and sent over a single connection to
        a hub which prepared the data for visualization by medical professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My final year of undergraduate studies was back at MSOE and mostly revolved around
        elective courses and senior design. I was extremely involved as both the primary engineer
        as well as the team leader. Through my previous internships at Plexus, I had experience
        with project development which made leading senior design an extension of those skills.
        Our design project, <a href="https://github.com/Ryandry1st/Wrist-Rescue">Wrist Rescue</a>,
        was a device which used onboard sensors and
        machine learning to monitor elderly citizens for dangerous falls. If a fall was
        recognized, the device would alert the user and if they did not decline assistance, it
        would initiate an emergency call through the user's phone. I was the primary developer
        in the state machine architecture, machine learning data and algorithm, and pcb layout.
